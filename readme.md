Welcome to "Weather of the Future", an openweathermap api app.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
• HTML
• CSS
• JavaScript ES6

HOW TO BUILD AND RUN:
Because this project uses basic technologies it
should run by simply launching index.html in a modern browser.
For location services to work, make sure you are visiting the
secure (https) version of the page when viewing on an external host.

COMPATIBILITY:
I have tested this app on the following browsers:
• Firefox 62.0.3 or newer
• Google Chrome 69.0.3 or newer
• Samsung Internet 7.4.00.70 or newer

TRADEOFFS:
• Animations vs efficiency
  -I am a big fan of speed. I usually turn off animations in
   any application that gives me the option to do so. There is a minor
   fade in/out animation when focusing the search fields and buttons.

WHAT I MIGHT ADD:
